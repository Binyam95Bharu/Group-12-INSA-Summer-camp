# Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit (RSDT)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit** is a cybersecurity project designed to:
- Simulate ransomware attacks in a controlled environment.
- Train cybersecurity teams on detection, analysis, and defense strategies.
- Provide hands-on experience in ransomware prevention and response.

## 🚀 Features
- **Ransomware Simulation** – Safe, sandboxed environment to test attack vectors.
- **Defense Dashboard** – Real-time alerts, incident response tools, and attack logs.
- **Forensics & Analysis Tools** – Examine encrypted files, trace attack origins, and study malicious payloads.
- **Incident Reporting System** – Automatically generate security incident reports.
- **Training Mode** – Guided simulations for educational purposes.

## 🎯 Importance in Real Cybersecurity
- **Practical Training**: Allows cybersecurity teams to practice responding to ransomware.
- **Improved Response Time**: Prepares teams for real-life cyber incidents.
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Helps organizations identify and patch security weaknesses.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js for dynamic UI)
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
