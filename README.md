# Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit (RSDT)

## Project Overview

The **Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit (RSDT)** is a cybersecurity project designed to simulate ransomware attacks in a controlled environment, allowing teams to test and improve their defense mechanisms. This toolkit is ideal for training, research, and security evaluation.

---

## Objectives

* Simulate ransomware behavior safely without damaging real systems.
* Help cybersecurity professionals practice incident response.
* Evaluate defense mechanisms effectiveness.
* Generate analytics and reports for ransomware attack scenarios.

---

## Features

* Ransomware attack simulation (file encryption, ransom note, persistence).
* Real-time defense monitoring and alerts.
* Incident response dashboard with logs.
* Backup and recovery modules.
* Training mode for guided exercises.
