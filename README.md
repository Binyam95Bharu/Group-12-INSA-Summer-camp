# 🛡️ Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit (RSDT)

## 📌 Overview
The **Ransomware Simulation & Defense Toolkit (RSDT)** is designed to simulate ransomware attacks in a safe, controlled environment and test various defense strategies. It helps security teams, researchers, and organizations understand attack vectors, evaluate protection methods, and improve incident response readiness.

## 🚀 Features
- **Safe Ransomware Simulation** – No real destructive payloads, only simulated encryption for testing.
- **Defense Strategy Testing** – Evaluate antivirus, endpoint protection, and backup systems.
- **Real-time Dashboard** – Monitor simulated attack progression.
- **Incident Response Training** – Practice containment, eradication, and recovery steps.

## 🖥️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)
- **Database:** SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL
- **Security Libraries:** cryptography (Python), OpenSSL
- **Visualization:** Chart.js / D3.js
- **Environment:** Docker for containerized testing

---

## 💻 System Requirements
- **OS:** Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Processor:** Quad-core or better
- **RAM:** 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **Storage:** 20GB free space
- **Software:** Python 3.9+, Node.js 16+, Docker, Git

If you want, I can now add a sample folder structure and basic code files so this README is ready to be used in GitHub with your project.
Do you want me to prepare that?
